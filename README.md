# 100 Days of JavaScript

The 100 Days of JavaScript project is a kind of challenge that aims to learn the JavaScript programming language by implementing some ideas.

Each such implementation is a mini-project, referred to as a "day", which you can go to and look at. In addition, 
there is an opportunity to get acquainted with the source code of each day. (Not avaiable now)

Each time I learn something new for myself and thereby improve my skills and abilities to work with this technology, 
which means that the further I go, the more complex and interesting ideas I will implement.

I started this project in the 11th grade. But now there is no time to finish it. It has already been 4 years since that time. 
It is sad that there is little opportunity to write code for the soul.
